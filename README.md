# What is the #66DaysOfData challenge?

Started by data scientist and YouTuber Kenneth Jee, the challenge is simple:
- Learn data science every day for 66 days, putting in at least 5 minutes per day.
- Share what I have learnt on my platform of choice.

# Why am I doing it?

- To build a daily learning habit by doing a little bit each day.
- To get comfortable with sharing my progress (especially when it comes to prospective admissions officers and employers).
- To find other aspiring bioinformaticians and gain feedback, build a community, and make self-learning more enjoyable.

| DAY | WHAT I LEARNT | RESOURCES |
|:-----:|:---------------|:-----------|
|1| - Learnt to interact between github and my local machine to create this repository.<br> - Uploaded a simple Python code that takes a DNA sequence as input and calculates its GC content. | Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course: https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk |
|2| - Completed Weeks 1-3 of the "Introduction to Probability and Data with R" course on Coursera. This included lectures and readings on experimental design, as well as basic birth rate statistics and data visualization using ggplot and other packages in RStudio.| - Introduction to Probability and Data with R - https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro <br> - Diez, D.M., CÌ§etinkaya-Rundel Mine and Barr, C.D. (2019) *OpenIntro Statistics*. 4th edn. openintro.org. |
|3| - Added more functions to the GC content program from Day 1 and turned it into a "DNA toolkit" that can: check an input DNA sequence's validity; give a nucleotide count; give a GC content percentage; transcribe the DNA sequence into its corresponding reverse-complement RNA sequence.<br> - Created a Python code that can generate a random DNA sequence of given length to use in testing other codes.<br> - Gained an introduction to Jupyter notebooks, its functions and shortcuts, and importing and exporting data. | Data Analysis with Python: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/ |
|4| - Created a multi-FASTA toolkit that can perform certain operations on a file containing multiple DNA sequences. ||
|5| - Slow day. :persevere: Only watched the introductory NumPy videos in the Data Analysis course.<br> (- Also learnt how to add emojis to markdown.) | Data Analysis with Python: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/ |
|6| - Completed Week 4 of the "Introduction to Probability and Data with R" course on Coursera. | Introduction to Probability and Data with R - https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro |
