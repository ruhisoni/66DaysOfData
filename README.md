# What is the #66DaysOfData challenge?

Started by data scientist and YouTuber Kenneth Jee, the challenge is simple:
- Learn data science every day for 66 days, putting in at least 5 minutes per day.
- Share what I have learnt on my platform of choice.

# Why am I doing it?

- To build a daily learning habit by doing a little bit each day.
- To get comfortable with sharing my progress (especially when it comes to prospective admissions officers and employers).
- To find other aspiring bioinformaticians and gain feedback, build a community, and make self-learning more enjoyable.
