# Day 1
Uploading GC-content.py was supposed to be a simple exercise of writing and uploading code. I have done this successfully.

### However, I have also had another today-I-learned (TIL) moment along the way.

Why care about GC content?

The GC content of a genome can tell us a lot about its genomic mapping, stability, and evolution.

One of the main reasons we look at GC percentages is that GC base pairs form triple hydrogen bonds, making them more stable than the double hydrogen bonded AT pairs.

Thus, organisms that live in high-temperature environments, like thermophilic bacteria, will have a higher genomic GC percentage than others.

### Is this true? This is what I was taught in high school and university biology.

However, genomic analysis has since shown us that the relationship is not so straightforward or universal.

For example, some studies has found no correlation between genomic DNA GC content of prokaryotes and their optimal growth temperatures. The study suggests prokaryotic genomic DNA faces other selective pressures, such as availability of nutrients, horizontal gene transfer, and mutational bias. However, it did find a trend between higher GC content in structural RNA and higher temperatures instead.

Other studies, however, claim that the link between genomic GC content and adaptive temperatures becomes more apparent with larger databases.

One thing I know for sure now, though: one of my sub-goals in my bioinformatics learning journey is to replicate studies like these so I can better understand why certain analytical tools and statistical techniques were used and preferred over others.
